## 2) **Project Title and Description**

> Title: NationStates Bot  
> Description: Simple Discord bot designed to be a wrapper for the online game [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net).

## 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment** 

> This increment we setup our bot to begin tracking nations, sending out and voting on issues, some basic formatting as well as newspaper generation for issues. Overall the bot's functionality is completed with only a few small fixes and formatting left to be taken care of.

## 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

> We didn't face many large scale challenges this increment, mainly just some small annoyances with image processing and generation as well as with formatting large xml responses from the api.
> 
> Part of our original plan was to allow users to set-up a private nation utilizing DMs, however in consideration of how Discord and Discord bots interact, we decided to instead remove that functionality. Because the user would have to be in a server with the bot anyways, we figured that if the user wanted to have private functionality the could instead just have an empty server with them and the bot.
>
> Nothing really went wrong this increment, other than a few bugs that were quickly caught and dealt with.
