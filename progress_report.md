## 2) **Project Title and Description**

> Title: NationStates Bot  
> Description: Simple Discord bot designed to be a wrapper for the online game [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net).

## 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment** 

> This increment we worked primarily on formatting responses from the various endpoints of the API as well as improving our own bot. Overall the project has reached completion. 

## 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

> The biggest challenge that cropped up this increment was handling .SVG files for newspaper generation. Because some of the responses from the NationStates API have SVG encoded images, we needed to add additional dependencies to the project.
> 
> During this increment the only change in scope was the removal of responses from the World API. This change occurred for two main reasons:
>> 1) We felt that our users would not find much use in the data that is returned from that endpoint.
>> 2) Discord's interactions limited our ability to interface with the endpoint in a meaningful way.
> 
> For the most part we only had one big issue crop up during the end of the increment: our solution to .SVG files. Those of us working on Windows systems could not properly run the bot after implementing the fix. In order to solve this issue, we had to install additional dependencies.
