> Originally we had planned on making a Discord bot that would allow FSU students to track their various graduation requirements. However upon review we felt that in     order to make this bot anything useful and longlasting, we would need far more time than originally thought. We then decided that we would still make a Discord bot,   however our focus has shifted from graduation tracking to making a wrapper for the [NationStates api](https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html).
