## 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment** 

> This increment we got our bot connected 

## 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

> This increment we faced challenges in things like formatting XML given the constraints of Discord embeds.
> 
> Part of our original plan was to allow users to set-up a private nation utilizing DMs, however in consideration of how Discord and Discord bots interact, we decided to instead remove that functionality. Because the user would have to be in a server with the bot anyways, we figured that if the user wanted to have private functionality the could instead just have an empty server with them and the bot.
