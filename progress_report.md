> Robert Whitworth, rw18cg, rwhitwo

## 2) **Project Title and Description**

> Title: NationStates Bot  
> Description: Simple Discord bot designed to be a wrapper for the online game [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net).

## 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment** 

> This increment we got the base of the bot set-up. We worked on getting a few commands implemented; commands to fetch nation information, region information, world assembly information, as well as some basic config commands. In the overall scope of what we're aiming for with this bot, we're a little under a third of the way to completeness. 

## 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

> The biggest challenge in this increment, outside of deciding to change focus, was just getting everyone familiar with [discord.py](ttps://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the design patterns for the project.
> 
> Originally we had planned on making a Discord bot that would allow FSU students to track their various graduation requirements. However upon review we felt that given the ever-changing nature course requirements, this project would be rendered obsolete very quickly. Since none of us want to work on something that will be useless in a matter of months, we decided to shift our focus from graduation tracking to making a wrapper (still in the form of a Discord bot) for the [NationStates api](https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html).
>
> There weren't many big issues that popped up during this increment. The main issue was a PostgreSQL issue; since we don't have a hosted database yet, we would get errors in running the bot if we didn't have a local database set up on our machine. 

## 5) **Team Member Contribution for this increment**
 
> 1) The progress report was written by Nicholas with contributions, in the form of challenges/goals/progress from everyone.
> 2) The software requirements and design document was written by Robert, this includes all sections/diagrams as well.
> 3) The software IT document was written by Cameron, this includes all sections.
> 4) Source code contributions:
>>> Joshua: Worked on all sections of the source code, including all commands and base setup of the bot.  
>>> Nicholas: Worked on region cog/ region controller which implemented commands for fetching region shards.  
>>> Tyler: Worked on setting up our encryption and decryption methods which will be used when we implement the database.
> 5) Everyone contributed to the video.

## 6) **Plans for the next increment**

> For the next increment we want to focus our efforts on connecting nations to the bot and setting up our database.
